# Ergonomic Inclusive Controller Keybord (EICK)

A type of ergonomic keyboard that will take input from either 2 virtual joysticks on their device screen or 2 physical joysticks of a pre-existing controller/gamepad.

The input is provided as a combination of gestures, i.e. swiping/flicking up on both joysticks will type the letter "A" (also known as a chord input). It requires the same amount of effort to type any letter, number or symbol. Removing the dependency of multiple small keys will make it accessible for people with physical disabilities. Also, the letters and numbers are positioned in a logical order making it easier for people with mental disabilities (especially autism) to use. We focused on the design characteristics and the chord coding to improve typing efficiency.

The first version released supports a simple notepad application taking in input. Further updates will support other apps (Such as WhatsApp and EverNote) and controlling the general OS GUI with the controller (Specific type of controller).

Will have different modes. The simple mode will only take input from the 2 analogue sticks. Furthur modes will take in input using multiple combinations such as the left and right trigger.

The simple mode will target disabled users who have difficulty with moving their fingers. The simple mode would only require 2 joysticks to operate and would not use other buttons and triggers.

The complex mode will target the users who want to type faster without the use of the on-screen keyboard. The complex mode would have the use of the basic 2 analog sticks plus the triggers at the back of the controller and other buttons.

Some examples of real-life use cases:
1. Better typing for people with disability.
2. Typing on gaming consoles and TV screens.
3. Taking notes in class without looking.
